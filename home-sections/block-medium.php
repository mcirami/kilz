		<p>Circumstances like fires, floods and persistent exposure to pets or smoke can produce severe stains. This is in addition to heavy duty, non-typical everyday wear and tear which can severely degrade and damage a surface. Tannins from certain types of wood create difficult to cover "bleeding" stains. Materials that are difficult to clean, hide or block cause other heavy stains. In worst-case scenarios, like disaster restoration projects, the job may require professionals with expert skills. Those professionals often look to the KILZÂ® brand for the solution. Here are some examples of medium to severe stains:
