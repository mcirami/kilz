		<p>Often when we repaint, we do it to change an existing color. And unlike stains, color does not leach or bleed through paint, so covering it is all that's needed. The hiding power of some paints may be limited. Using a coat of a quality primer like KILZ 2® Latex before painting—particularly if you are painting over bright or dark colors—will help produce better results, reducing the need for multiple coats of paint and allowing truer, richer color. For drastic color changes, KILZ® primer can also be tinted to help the color transition. This tinting helps reduce the number of paint topcoats.
