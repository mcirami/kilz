		<p>Did you know you can paint almost anything if you prime first? It's true. Ordinary paint may not stick to slick, glossy surfaces. Without proper priming to provide adhesion, paint may peel, flake, crack or blister. Primers are formulated to add grip to those types of surfaces, including aluminum, vinyl, PVC, even ceramic tile and glass block. Don't forget to properly prepare the surface before you prime. This will help ensure the best possible outcome.
