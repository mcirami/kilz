<h1>Helps Block And Seal Odors</h1>

		<p>They're everywhere. In musty basements with excess humidity, in bathrooms, older kitchens with a generation of food prep, in the dogs' corner of the den, even bedrooms and living rooms; odor-carrying molecules are ever-present in our homes. And they can penetrate the dry film of paint. Priming the affected surface before painting helps block those odors, preventing them from seeping out. Additionally, the odor-sealing properties in primer help provide a barrier so odor molecules can't penetrate the new paint. KILZ MAX®—our ultimate water-based stain and odor blocker—is a great solution for medium to severe odors, including those from major smoke damage and pets.</p>
