		<p>Mildew is a common problem in areas with excessive moisture. Painting over mildew and mold is a temporary solution at best and not recommended. Cleaning mildew and mold off the surface then allowing it to dry completely before starting the painting process is a necessity to ensure the problem doesn't return. Selecting a Kilz primer with a mildew resistant finish, in addition to choosing the right topcoat with similar protection, will help ensure that your new finish is protected against future mildew growth.</p>
