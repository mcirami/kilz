			KILZ® Color Change Ceiling Paint is for interior use, and primes and paints in one step. It blocks ceiling stains, is self-priming and is spatter resistant. The paint color changes from pink to white as it dries so you'll never miss a spot again. KILZ® Color Change Ceiling Paint is a unique combination of stainblocking technology and a coverage/dry time indicator. It rolls on easily with minimal spattering and a subtle pink color that quickly dries to white. It can be used on all interior ceilings.
