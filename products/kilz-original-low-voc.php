		<h2>Surface Preparation<sup>&dagger;</sup></h2>
		<ul>
			<li>

				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Remove all mildew with a commercially available mildew remover, rinse well and then allow to dry. Note: KILZ PREMIUM and KILZ 2 are recommended for mildew-prone surfaces.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Unpainted, exterior wood exposed to sun and/or moisture longer than 2-4 weeks must be cleaned and sanded before priming.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					For maximum adhesion, scrape off loose paint and scuff sand the surface thoroughly before priming. On glossy surfaces: scuff sand the surface thoroughly before priming.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Application</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					Eye protection is recommended.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					For best results, use when substrate and air temperatures are between 35&deg;F (2&deg;C) and 90&deg;F (32&deg;C).
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Stir or mix prior to and during use, do not thin.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Prime the entire surface to ensure a uniform appearance of the topcoat.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Tough stains may require two coats to block completely.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					KILZ ORIGINAL may be used on clean, dry, aged masonry surfaces that have cured (dried) at least 90 days. If masonry has cured less than 90 days, use KILZ PREMIUM, KILZ 2 or KILZ ODORLESS.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Coverage varies by surface. Coverage will be approximately 300 square feet per gallon on rough surfaces; up to 400 square feet per gallon on smooth, nonporous surfaces.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Can be tinted with up to 2 ounces of universal colorant per gallon.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Dry Time at 77&deg;F (25&deg;C), 50% RH</h2>

		</p>
		<h2><sup>&dagger;</sup>Danger!</h2>
		<p>If you scrape, sand, or remove old paint, you may release lead dust. <strong>LEAD IS TOXIC. EXPOSURE TO LEAD DUST CAN CAUSE SERIOUS ILLNESS, SUCH AS BRAIN DAMAGE, ESPECIALLY IN CHILDREN.
				PREGNANT WOMEN SHOULD ALSO AVOID EXPOSURE.</strong> Wear a NIOSH-approved respirator to control lead exposure. Clean up carefully with a HEPA vacuum and a wet mop.
			Before you start, find out how to protect yourself and your family by contacting the National Lead Information Hotline at 1-800-424-LEAD or log on to <a href="http://www.epa.gov/lead">www.epa.gov/lead</a>.  </p>
		<p>
			<strong>CONTAINS PETROLEUM DISTILLATES. VAPOR HARMFUL:</strong>  May affect the brain or nervous system causing dizziness, headache, or nausea. Causes eye, skin, nose and throat irritation.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>USE ONLY WITH ADEQUATE VENTILATION:</strong>  Do not breathe vapors or spray mist. Ensure fresh air entry during application and drying.
			If you experience eye watering, headache, or dizziness, or if air monitoring demonstrates vapor / mist levels are above applicable limits, wear an appropriate, properly fitted respirator (NIOSH / MSHA TC 23C or equivalent) during and after application. Follow respirator manufacturer’s direction for respirator use. Avoid contact with eyes, skin and clothing. Wash thoroughly after handling and before smoking and eating.

		<p>
			<strong>NOTICE:</strong> Reports have associated repeated and prolonged occupational overexposure to solvents with permanent brain and nervous system damage. Intentional misuse by deliberately concentrating and inhaling the contents may be harmful or fatal.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>VAPORS MAY CAUSE FLASH FIRE:</strong>  Vapors can flow along surfaces to a distant ignition source and flash back. Keep away from heat, sparks and flame. Do not smoke. Extinguish all flames and pilot lights and turn off stoves, heaters, electric motors and other sources of ignition during use and until all vapors are gone. Prevent build-up of vapors by opening all windows and doors to achieve cross-ventilation. To avoid spontaneous combustion, soak soiled rags and waste immediately after use in a closed, water filled metal container. See clean-up and disposal for more information.
		</p>
		<h2>First Aid</h2>
		<p>
			If swallowed, do not induce vomiting. Get medical attention immediately. If you experience difficulty in breathing, leave the area to obtain fresh air. If continued difficulty is experienced, get medical attention immediately. In case of eye contact, flush eyes immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes and get medical attention; for skin, wash thoroughly with soap and water.
